          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is this a wedding?</span> We got married this past Halloween in a small ceremony with our immediate family. It was magical—see the <a href="/wedding-photos">photographic evidence</a>—but we didn't get to celebrate with <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>all</span> the people we love. This event is our opportunity to celebrate with y'all! It's a post-wedding summer solstice house party.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a registry?</span> Your presence is a present; you do not need to get us anything! But if you must lavish us with gifts, here are <a href="https://www.myregistry.com/wedding-registry/wren-sieber-and-anthony-baker-woodstock-ny/4462756/giftlist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some things</a> we're fiending for.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will there be transportation?</span>No, please coordinate your own transportation. Ubers are a bit limited up here so please carpool and use a designated driver!</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will Wren spill wine on me if I wear white?</span> On the contrary, she may if you don't! See the recommended <a href="/dresscode">dresscode.</a>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What can I bring?</span> Please bring lawn chairs or folding chairs, if you can. And a good attitude.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I bring a plus one? Can I bring my kids?</span>Yes and yes. Please let us know when you <a href="https://airtable.com/appXCQL1B69Npnk6J/paguUPqMnkMMt9B62/form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSVP</a>.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will there be food?</span> Yes! We'll have pizza, snacks, and plenty to drink.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Should I wear 6" stilettos?</span> Probably not! We'll be hanging out on our lawn. But what do we care, go for it if you want.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is your house called The Pizza Hut?</span> Wait til you see our roofline.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I've got some downtime, what should I do?</span> We've compiled some of our <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=124WGIvWeAQnVXluPLF0pSd_5rKt753k&usp=sharing' target="_blank">favorite nearby places!</a></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Are there optional events the day before or after?</span> Yes!</p> 
          <p>On Friday, June 20th, we're having dinner at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YtMiLEV8aQWhtYpQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Fe</a> at 7pm. It's $40/per person for food and there will be a cash bar. To RSVP, please Venmo @carolineonmulberry $40 for each person you're paying for and write their names in the “What's This For?” line. Don't have Venmo? Text Caroline at 609-577-0117 to let her know you're coming and pay her in a different manner.</p> 
          <p>On Sunday, June 22nd, we plan on taking Chaga for a 60 minute walk by the reservoir at 10AM. We'll meet in the parking lot at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XMTK8s41axN7NBpD9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodstock Dike Rail Trail</a> if you want to join.</p>
